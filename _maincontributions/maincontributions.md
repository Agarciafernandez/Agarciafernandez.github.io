**The GOSPA metric [[G1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8009645) is a mathematically principled metric to measure the distance between two sets of targets for evaluation of multi-target filtering algorithms**. The metric penalises localisation errors for properly detected targets, and the number of missed and false targets, see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M79GTTytvCM).

**The trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric [[G2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9127194) is a mathematically principled metric to measure the distance between two sets of trajectories for evaluation of multi-target tracking algorithms**. It penalises localisation errors for properly detected targets, the number of missed and false targets, and the number of track switches.

The GOSPA metric has also been extended to graphs to measure the distance between graphs [[G3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10644126). The graph GOSPA metric penalises localisation errors for properly detected nodes, the number of missed and false nodes, and edge mismatch errors.
