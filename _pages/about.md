I am an Associate Professor at the Information Processing and Telecommunications Center, ETSI de Telecomunicación, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. Previously, I was a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the University of Liverpool, UK. I also held postdoctoral positions at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, Curtin University, Australia, and Aalto University, Finland. 

My main research activities and interests are in the area of Bayesian inference, with emphasis on multiple target tracking and probabilistic machine learning.

These are some of my main research contributions.

Generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric
---------------

The GOSPA metric proposed in [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8009645) is a mathematically principled metric to measure the distance between two sets of targets. The metric is used for evaluation of multi-target filters and it penalises localisation errors for properly detected targets, and the number of missed and false targets.

The trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric proposed in [[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9127194) is a mathematically principled metric to measure the distance between two sets of trajectories for evaluation of multi-target tracking algorithms. It penalises localisation errors for properly detected targets, the number of missed and false targets, and includes a track switching cost.

The GOSPA metric has also been extended to graphs to measure the distance between graphs [[3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10644126). In this case, it penalises localisation errors for properly detected nodes, the number of missed and false nodes, and Edge mismatch errors.

Applications
======

I have worked in many different applications including: 
- Multi-target tracking (radar, sonar, drones, space-objects, sensor management, distributed acoustic sensing, computer vision).
- Simultaneous localisation and mapping (5-G, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth).
- Gaussian process inference (molecular property prediction, classification).
- Perception for advanced driver assistance systems.
- Health (fMRI and EEG signal processing).
- Battery state-of-charge estimation.
