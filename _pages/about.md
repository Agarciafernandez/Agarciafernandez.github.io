I am an Associate Professor at the Information Processing and Telecommunications Center, ETSI de Telecomunicación, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. Previously, I was a Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. I also held postdoctoral positions at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, Curtin University, Perth, Australia, and Aalto University, Espoo, Finland. 

My main research activities and interests are in the area of Bayesian inference, with emphasis on multiple target tracking and machine learning.

I have worked in many different applications including: radar, perception for advanced driver assistance systems, sonar, space object tracking, space object manoeuvre detection, sensor management for multi-target tracking systems, distributed acoustic sensing, molecular property prediction, Gaussian process inference, fMRI and EEG signal processing, indoor localisation with a smartphone via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, drones for traffic monitoring, battery state-of-charge estimation, computer vision...
