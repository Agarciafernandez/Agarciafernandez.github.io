I am an **Associate Professor** at the [Information Processing and Telecommunications Center](https://iptc.upm.es/), ETSI de Telecomunicación, [**Universidad Politécnica de Madrid**](https://www.upm.es/internacional). Before then, I was a Senior Lecturer at the **University of Liverpool**, UK. Previously, I held postdoctoral positions at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, **Chalmers University of Technology**, Sweden, **Curtin University**, Australia, and **Aalto University**, Finland. As a PhD student, I also did two research stays at the **University of Melbourne**, Australia. 

My main research activities and interests are in the area of Bayesian inference, with emphasis on multiple target tracking and probabilistic machine learning.

I am a member of [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/person/angel-garcia-fernandez) and Associate Editor of the [IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems](https://ieee-aess.org/contact/angel-f-garcia-fernandez) and IEEE Access.

Research interests
======

I work in many different areas including: 
- Multi-target tracking (radar, sonar, space objects, drones, traffic monitoring, distributed acoustic sensing, computer vision).
- Bayesian filtering and smoothing.
- Sensor management and control.
- Inference over graphs via belief propagation.
- Parallel computation applied to Bayesian inference problems.
- Simultaneous localisation and mapping (5-G, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth).
- Gaussian process inference (molecular property prediction, classification).
- Perception for advanced driver assistance systems.
- Health (fMRI and EEG signal processing).
- Battery state-of-charge estimation.
- Financial portfolio management using reinforcement learning.
