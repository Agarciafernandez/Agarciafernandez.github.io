I am an Associate Professor at the Information Processing and Telecommunications Center, ETSI de Telecomunicación, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. Previously, I was a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics at the University of Liverpool, UK. I also held postdoctoral positions at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, Curtin University, Australia, and Aalto University, Finland. 

My main research activities and interests are in the area of Bayesian inference, with emphasis on multiple target tracking and probabilistic machine learning.


Main contributions

Applications
======

I have worked in many different applications including: 
- Multi-target tracking (radar, sonar, drones, space-objects, sensor management, distributed acoustic sensing, computer vision).
- Simultaneous localisation and mapping (5-G, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth).
- Gaussian process inference (molecular property prediction, classification).
- Perception for advanced driver assistance systems.
- Health (fMRI and EEG signal processing).
- Battey state-of-charge estimation.


Awards
======
